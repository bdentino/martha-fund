                <p>In its first year as a Community charity of the ING New York City marathon, Allied services raised $120,000! The team of five runners, lead by WNEP-TV's Ryan Leckey, was overwhelmed by the show of support, which allowed Allied Services to continue to provide services to children without regard for their insurance status or their parents' ability to pay.</p>

              <div class="timeline-body">
                <p>From the huge success of its first year, Ryan's Run moved up to Bronze Charity Status. Fifteen additional spots were added to the team for a total of 20 runners. The team doubled their funds from the first year by raising more than $226,000 for Allied Services. This incredible success allowed Allied Services to purchase two Aretech Zero-Gs, the world's most advanced overground gait and balance training system. They are now helping patients recovering from stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury and other neurological conditions, helping them to begin standing and walking earlier in their rehabilitation.</p>

              <div class="timeline-body">
                <p>In its third year, the Ryan's Run team totaled 25 runners! Continuing on as a Bronze charity, the team raised over $260,000, investing in equipment and services throughout Allied Services. Thanks to Ryan's Run 3, we were able to invest in the SMART Equitest, a piece of rehabilitation equipment used to evaluate and treat balance problems. The funds were also used to expand the music therapy services available to patients and to purchase rehabilitation equipment to benefit children with sensory integration conditions.</p>
                <p>When the marathon was cancelled due to the effects of superstorm Sandy, the team rallied, turning marathon-Sunday into an opportunity to collect and later that week, distribute relief supplies to storm damaged communities in New York and New Jersey. "Ryan's Run" was recently named by the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters as an "Outstanding Television Public Service Campaign."</p>

                <p>In 2014, a team of almost 50 runners took to the streets of New York City for the ING New York City Marathon.  For the first time, the campaign featured the Ryan’s Run 5k and All-Abilities Walk, an event that allowed supporters, runners, patients and their families to join together to celebrate the achievements of the team and Allied’s patients. Funds raised through RR4 enabled Allied to invest in technology that helps children and adults with speech impairments; a device that helps people recovering from stroke and brain injuries to regain function of their arms and hands; technology that helps children with cerebral palsy to gain strength and flexibility. The funds also enable Allied to invest in new ventilators for the region’s only dedicated ventilator unit at Allied Skilled Nursing & Rehab Center.</p>

Funds raised in 2014 were invested in therapeutic services, such as music therapy, and new technology, such as the Reo-Go, a device that benefits stroke and brain injury patients.</p>

                    <p>Corey Burns (or as Ryan Leckey refers to him as “The Brother He Never Had!”) is lacing up to run the TCS NYC Marathon, yet again as part of the &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s Run&#8221; crew.</p>
<p>This marathon will be Corey&#8217;s sixth in all. Corey will again run alongside fellow “Team Leckey” runners, camera in hand, documenting the journey through the five boroughs. Corey’s best New York City Marathon finish time was 3:43:25 in 2011. Corey and Ryan finished last year’s race just in over 5 hours, but had a blast along the way. </p>
<p>When Corey is not manning the camera with Ryan for many “Leckey Live” segments in the early morning hours on WNEP-TV, where he also plays the role of Assistant Chief Photographer, and chasing his two children (Corey &#038; Téa) with his wife (Erin) at home, you can find him training at CrossFit Scranton, and running the many hills in Factoryville in preparation for November’s race through NYC’s five boroughs.</p>
<p>Corey is not only excited to run as part of the “Ryan’s Run 6″ crew, but is also enthusiastic to share the inspiring stories of recovery and rehabilitation, which are at the core of this campaign. The stories from 2012’s &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s Run 3&#8243; campaign turned &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s Recovery&#8221; are still the most inspiring. With the cancellation of the 2012 ING NYC marathon due to the damaging effects from Superstorm Sandy, &#8220;Team Leckey&#8221; rallied, on the same Sunday the marathon was to be held, to collect much needed supplies for the east coast communities affected by the storm. Ultimately, the stories from &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s Run 3 turned Ryan&#8217;s Recovery&#8221; garnered a Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters award for &#8220;Outstanding Television Public Service Campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please join Corey, and the entire &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s Run 6&#8243; team in continuing to make this award winning campaign grow to a higher level for the children and adults with disabilities served by Allied Services. </p>

                    <p>My name is Matt Corcoran. I grew up at the Jersey Shore, Brigantine to be exact and now live just outside of Philadelphia. Sports and fitness have always been a big part of my life.</p>
<p>In high school and college I was a rower. After graduating I needed something to satisfy my need to stay in shape and compete at the same time, running was a natural fit. About 5 years ago I started really taking it seriously and have since completed a handful of marathons as well as numerous events at shorter distances.  </p>
<p>Most of the marathons I have done are smaller events, and I never thought I had a desire to do any of the big races. However, after learning about Ryan’s Run and the services that are provided as a result, I jumped at the chance to compete in the 2015 TCS New York City Marathon. Before given this opportunity, I had no idea what Ryan’s Run and Allied Services were about, but after reading about wha they have accomplished and who they have helped in such a short amount of time, I was truly inspired. I know I will be able to use that motivation out on the course come November 1st.</p>

                    <p>I am running the TCS New York City Marathon as a part of Ryan’s Run 6 this fall because of two events in my life that inspired me. First, for two important people, who are Cooper and Ryan. My first born child, Cooper, passed away of a rare cell storage disorder as an infant. He was never able to run, walk, or even stand. I want to complete this race in his memory. Ryan is the son of my very dear friends, Dr. Tom and Sandi Kislan. Ryan will never be able to run due to cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>Secondly, about four years ago, I was in a serious car accident. The car flipped several times and I was ejected. I had significant damage throughout my body and my knee had to be completely reconstructed. It was not certain I would be able to walk again, certainly not to train as I have. I believe the body and mind are resilient. I want to run this race as a part of my own recovery, as well as for those who are unable.</p>
<p>I own Cloud9 Personal Training and Fitness in Drums, PA. I have been an ISSA Certified Personal Trainer for a decade, and recently became a CrossFit Level 1 Trainer. I grew up in Paris, France. Fitness has been a big part of my life since my youth. I competed at the Junior National Level of Kickboxing, even becoming a Junior National Champion. Since then, I became a permanent resident of the United States. I have continued my passion for fitness through my gym, MMA Fighting, and completing various 5K, 10K, half marathons, marathons, Tough Mudders, and the Spartan Race for charity. I do not have the typical lean runner’s physique. As a fighter and gym owner, my focus has largely been on lifting with bursts of cardio. So, long distance running has always been a bit out of my comfort zone. I want to push myself out of my comfort zone and inspire my clients to do the same.</p>

                    <p>I am 32 years old and reside in Olyphant, PA. I started running about five years ago when I was 27.  I ran two full Steamtown Marathons, three half marathons, several 5K races, and one ultra 50 mile marathon, the JFK 50, in Boonsboro, MD.</p>
<p>On September 12, 2014, I was critically wounded while working as a Pennsylvania State Trooper. I was shot in the pelvic area. I had several surgeries which included replacement of my right femur and total right hip replacement. My goal is to run a marathon again after all the surgeries and prove that nothing can keep you from doing what you love. I chose Ryan’s Run because this charity helps so many people that have similar physical disabilities as I now have.</p>

<p>Eleven years ago our lives were forever changed when our daughter was born nine weeks early. She was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. This is where our journey with Allied Services began. Allied has truly made a difference in Kylie’s life.</p>
<p>I am running the TCS New York City Marathon not only for my family, but for everyone who cannot run, like my daughter. Kylie is my inspiration. She has shown me that anything is possible with hard work and determination. I couldn’t think of a better way to honor her and all of her accomplishments.</p>

<p>This year, I hope to complete my 9th TCS New York City Marathon by participating in Ryan’s Run. I have mentored other TCS New York City Marathon runners for Team for Kids, which is the official charity of the New York Road Runners.   </p>
<p>Our family supports Allied Services and have benefited greatly from their quality care. My sister-in-law, Sherry Davidowitz, serves on the Board of Directors of Allied Services John Heinz Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine.</p>
<p>Ryan’s Run has evolved to be one of the most successful charity running teams in the country. Each year, it easily fills its roster with devoted runners/fundraisers.  It benefits from extraordinary community support. Ryan Leckey, Corey Burns and the remarkable staff at Allied Services work tirelessly to help us stay at the top and raise the vital funds to help people with disabilities.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to support Allied Services and come out to New York City to cheer on the runners. It may be the largest sporting event in the world. There will be 50,000 runners from all 50 states and over 100 countries. Along the course, there will be over 100 live bands performing a wide variety of music and more than 2 million very enthusiastic spectators.  </p>

                    <p>I am truly honored to be selected as a runner with Ryan’s Run 6 and I look forward to the journey ahead! I am a resident of Old Forge, PA and a graduate of La Salle University. I began running almost two years ago. In 2014, my father and I committed to training for our first half marathon, the 2014 Scranton Half Marathon. When I began training, I was living in Philadelphia at the time. However, I was extremely motivated by my father, as we stuck to the same training plan. I would even come home to do long Sunday runs with him. At this time, it helped me feel connected to my family still.</p>
<p>Since then, I have moved back home to be closer to my friends and family. I am now employed at MetLife as a Change Management Analyst.<br />
After completing the 2014 Scranton Half Marathon, running truly became my passion that I share with my father and younger sister. Since then, I have completed the 2014 and 2015 Broad Street Run, the 2015 Scranton Half Marathon, the Rock ‘n’ Roll Virginia Beach Half Marathon, the Rock ‘n’ Roll Philadelphia Half Marathon, and the Rock ‘n’ Roll DC Half Marathon. The positive experiences I have gained so far through running have led to my interest in Ryan’s Run.</p>
<p>Knowing the positive services provided to Northeast Pennsylvania, I am extremely grateful and excited to be selected as a runner for Team Leckey in support of Allied Services. It is a privilege to learn more about Allied Services and my community though Ryan&#8217;s Run. While the TCS New York City Marathon will be my first full marathon, I am eager and motivated to finish knowing the community support I will have through this opportunity.</p>

                    <p>A native from NEPA, I reside in Mountain Top with my wonderful children, Natalie, Jacob, and our beagle, Abby. I have been a physical therapist at Allied Services at John Heinz Rehab Hospital for over 16 years. During this time, I have been fortunate to see firsthand the lives that are touched by the technology and services that are provided by the Ryan&#8217;s Run campaign. Now in my second year of being on the team, I hope to raise more awareness for this great cause that benefits children and adults in our area. </p>
<p>Since taking up running a few years back, I have been fortunate to finish 9 half marathons, 5 marathons, and earlier this year, my first ultramarathon. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed trail running compared to road running, especially in events like central PA&#8217;s Dam Half Marathon, Hyner Challenge and  Megatransect. However, last year&#8217;s NYC Marathon with the windy and cold weather proved to be one of the toughest and most rewarding challenges to date.</p>
<p>Before the end of the year, I plan to complete 5 more distance races and continue my personal goal of running all of Pennsylvania&#8217;s State Parks. Most importantly, I am hopeful for a successful completion of the NYC marathon for our Ryan&#8217;s Run 6 team with the largest fund raising campaign in its history. </p>

                    <p>I first started running five years ago, primarily to get in shape and become healthier; however it soon turned into my lifeline. I found myself obsessed and very willing to try long distance races. So, I whole-heartedly jumped right into a marathon and fell in love with the challenge. I haven’t stopped yet, completing four marathons. The 2015 TCS New York City Marathon will be my fifth. I am very excited to once again be running with Team Leckey.</p>
<p>I reside in Clarks Green with my husband and five children. My family has been such a great support system for me.  I teach Spanish at Holy Cross High School.  I absolutely love what I do. Each and every day I try to encourage my students to be the best they can be and to always help one other. I also try to instill the motto, “never ever give up.”  It is very important to me to set good examples for both my children and my students and right now, running for Allied Services is a great way to show it. My hope is that someday they will do the same.</p>
<p>In 2013 as I was getting ready to leave for the New York City Marathon, a co-worker truly inspired me with this message she shared with our entire school.  &#8220;She will run on Sunday so others may walk again, she will run so that others may feed themselves again, she will run so others may get up and be able to get dressed for the day, and she will run so that others may build up the strength to go home.”  I took that message with me, and will take it again as I run through the streets of New York for those who are unable.  </p>

                    <p>Stephanie Jones moved to the Scranton area 4 years ago and is thrilled and honored to represent her company, Jack Williams, in the Ryan&#8217;s Run journey.  Stephanie became an avid CrossFitter shortly after moving to the area and fell in love with fitness.  She even earned a CrossFit Level 1 Certification last year. Now ready to take her fitness journey a step further, Stephanie will be participating in the TCS NYC marathon along with the 34 other Ryan’s Run team members.</p>
<p>The work that Allied Services does is near and dear to Stephanie&#8217;s heart.  When Stephanie was just a baby, a car accident left her mother with a tremendous amount of brain damage requiring an immense amount of therapy.  The resources Allied Services offers are monumental in providing care, research, therapy, and recovery to those in need.</p>
<p>“I am inspired by the athletes I train with on a daily basis, and have had the privilege of training with and meeting people driven by heart and goodwill; I&#8217;m thrilled to broaden that group by being a part of Ryan&#8217;s Run.”-Stephanie Jones </p>

                    <p>I am proud to be running for such an incredible cause as a member of Ryan’s Run 6. I work as a Reading Specialist/Response to Intervention Teacher at Stroudsburg Area School District. I live in Roaring Brook Township and have two daughters, Cassie and Caroline.</p>
<p>I started running when I turned 40, with the now simple, but then daunting goal of being able to run all the way around Lake Scranton. I did my first ever 5K that year; it was such a big deal for me. Unfortunately soon after, I was sidelined with a breast cancer diagnosis at age 41. I underwent a full year of treatment. I had so much to overcome, but I met the most amazing and supportive people through the running community. They gave me the motivation and inspiration to complete another 5K after my diagnosis and treatment. Since then, I have been busy training and racing whenever possible; I became hooked on the sport of running. In addition to numerous 5K’s, I have completed two Broad Street Runs in Philadelphia, and three half marathons.</p>
<p>Along my journey, I was lucky enough to run into some participants of Ryan’s Run 5. I participated in the Ryan’s Run 5K in 2014, and it was a life changing experience. Seeing children who received therapy at Allied Services overcome their own struggle was so inspirational. I also attended the 2014 New York City Marathon in support of Ryan’s Run 5. Each team member was dedicated to the mission of raising money for Allied Services, an amazing facility we are lucky to have in our area. It is my honor to take on the challenge of my first marathon this year to support Allied Services!</p>

                    <p>Throughout the years, I have run races for myself. This year, I will run for all those who cannot. I am co-owner of CrossFit Blarney Stone, a functional fitness gym in Duryea, PA. I have been a fitness enthusiast my entire life, and have been running competitively since high school. I have completed seven marathons and with each race, my goal is to run faster. This year, as I run the 2015 TCS New York City Marathon, my goal is to raise funds for Allied Services in support of my friend Alex Douglass.</p>
<p>For the past five years, I have run everything from a 5K to a 50-miler, as well as thousands of training miles with Alex. This past fall, Alex and I had planned on running our final race together because I had decided to retire my running shoes. Tragically, Alex was critically injured in the line of duty as a Pennsylvania State Trooper. For the first time in five years, I ran without him but carried him in my heart.</p>
<p>As Alex recovered, I witnessed courage and strength beyond words. Within a month of his recovery, he was talking about running again; he wanted to run another marathon. With the help of the brilliant and dedicated therapists at Allied Services, Alex is walking again after his life-changing injury. He has decided to run the 2015 TCS New York City Marathon. With your support, Alex and I will run side-by-side one more time.</p>

                    <p>I am from Kingston, PA. I have been married to Amy for 18 years and we have three wonderful daughters, Holly, Olivia, and Gwendolyn. I have worked for Allied Services Integrated Health Systems for 15 years and I’m currently the Assistant Vice President of the Systems Improvement Department. I have been on the Ryan’s Run team for the past five years.</p>
<p>For the past couple of months, my life has been anything but the epitome of balance.  With my oldest going off to college and my younger two being active in school and sports, it is sometimes difficult to find the time to shower let alone 2 ½ hours for a long run.<br />
I psych myself up to get some early miles in only to snooze away the time. Then I decide to run during a lunch break and work seems to get in the way. Sitting at my desk eating something that resembles a lunch and weeding through reports is the prescribed workout. A day off turns to a week off and I feel like I am going backwards. Getting back on the wagon is something only seen on reruns of Bonanza. </p>
<p>These circumstances that take over our lives are not going away. Making time to exercise, mentally decompressing, and eating healthy will not just happen and at times take a back seat. </p>
<p>Intentionally, building small habits that promote healthy lifestyles will help when everything else seems like more of a priority in your life. Meditating for 2 minutes at lunch, packing your healthy lunch the night before, having green smoothies for your morning snack, and taking the stairs instead of the elevator are all examples of this. </p>
<p>Remember one thing as you feel like life is off the rails; “You have to take care of yourself in order to take care of others.”</p>

                    <p>Emmy nominated television personality Ryan Leckey is the chairman of the “Ryan’s Run” campaign for Allied Services. With Ryan’s knack for producing engaging live and nontraditional television, Allied knew he was the perfect pick to help spearhead this campaign which first started in 2010.  </p>
<p>To date, “Ryan’s Run” has raised close to one million dollars to help kids and adults with disabilities throughout Northeastern &#038; Central Pennsylvania. The campaign has also received multiple honors. “Ryan’s Run” was named by the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters as an “Outstanding Television Public Service Campaign.” The NYC Marathon organizers also recognized the campaign as a Bronze Charity because of the significant amount of money it raises each year in such a short amount of time. The Bronze Charity status puts “Ryan’s Run” on the same world stage as the Michael J. Fox &#038; the Christopher &#038; Dana Reeve Foundations. Ryan credits the success of the campaign to the generous and caring people in Northeastern &#038; Central Pennsylvania along with support from WNEP-TV, especially station management, and Ryan’s morning photographer/the guy he calls “the brother he never had,” Corey Burns. The pair work daily together on Newswatch 16 This Morning.  </p>
<p>Ryan, who Pennsylvania viewers often call “The Leckenator,” is the producer/host of “Leckey Live,” an almost daily segment on Newswatch 16 This Morning. It airs on WNEP-TV, an ABC affiliate based near Scranton, Pennsylvania. WNEP-TV is America’s highest rated ABC affiliate and is a television station dedicated to giving back to the viewers it serves. “Leckey Live” is a segment on Newswatch 16 that covers everything from community events to breaking news as well as special projects including rare behind the scenes looks at television show’s like ABC’s The View, The Chew, and LIVE With Kelly &#038; Michael.  Ryan’s other in-depth reports have included one-on-one interviews with TV icons including:  Regis Philbin, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer and former President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Ryan describes himself as a social media addict who got his first break in television at the age of 18 on WJAC-TV (NBC) in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. While working in his hometown, Ryan reported, anchored, and even did fill-in-weather for WJAC’s morning show. He worked while completing his undergraduate degree in Communication Arts at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. Just months after graduation and four years in television, Ryan landed his next TV job at WNEP. Soon after moving to the Scranton area, Ryan earned his Master’s degree in Media Management at Marywood University. It’s also at Marywood where Ryan worked as an adjunct faculty member where he taught courses for five years in Broadcast News Writing and Media Performance.</p>
<p>Ryan’s other accomplishments while working in Northeastern &#038; Central Pennsylvania include being named an “Outstanding Young Pennsylvanian” (Nov. 2011) by the commonwealth’s Jaycees organization for his dedication to so many charitable causes.  Also, an Emmy Nomination for his Spot News coverage during record flooding in the spring of 2011 and another honor for his contribution to an Emmy Nominated Newscast in 2007. Ryan provided multiple live reports from a shutdown highway during the infamous Valentine’s Day Snowstorm. Electric City Magazine has named Ryan “Best Local TV Personality” over the past three years. </p>
<p>When Ryan’s not on the air or volunteering as a host at various community events, ‘The Leckenator’ can be found working out at CrossFit Scranton, a place he considers his second home. Ryan credits CrossFit Scranton, Mission Yoga, and his good friend, Allied therapist Cathy Guzzi, for helping him stay as healthy as possible while following his passion for fitness. One fun fact:  Ryan has written/recorded several original songs and released his first album “Just Getting Started” on January 13, 2012. You can hear them at http://ryanleckey.com/music/</p>

                    <p>There are a few things in life I am very passionate about; my children, helping others, and running top the list. Having the privilege to join Ryan’s Run 6 has married all three of those passions.</p>
<p>I have had the good fortune of running since I was in high school and continuing that passion to the present day. I have completed numerous marathons, half marathons, and local 5K and 10K races. Recently, I made the leap to an ultra marathon in which I completed 74.5 miles. The running community in Northeastern Pennsylvania has grown extensively and that is no more evident than in the Scranton Running Company and Barrier Breakers. Having coached in the program since 2013, it has had a significant effect on the health of the local community.</p>
<p>Running the TCS New York City Marathon has been on my bucket list for many years and with the help of Allied Services and Ryan&#8217;s Run I am eager to complete it for those who cannot. Just imagine being told you can&#8217;t walk or do physical activity for a week or worse yet a month, now imagine being in a wheelchair for life. These are some of the challenges faced by many of the patients that Allied Services helps on a daily basis. It is my hope that by participating in this worthwhile cause we can contribute to the care Allied Services provides to our community!</p>

                    <p>I am a wife and mother of two amazing boys, Peter who is four, and Henry who is six months. I am a Physician specializing in Rehabilitation Medicine and sub-specializing in Spinal Cord Injury Medicine. I do everything to the extreme, including cooking particularly healthy. It’s not unusual for my husband to ask me if I left the sugar and butter out of my cookies.</p>
<p>The 2015 TCS New York City Marathon will be my 11th marathon, yet my first New York City Marathon. I haven’t completed a sanctioned marathon since before my first son was born. Although in 2013, my husband and I ran a marathon that we mapped ourselves to honor babies that are lost during pregnancy.</p>
<p>My life changed when I went to the hospital, unable to stop coughing at 38 weeks pregnant with my second son. I had an emergency c-section and woke up three weeks later in the ICU at Lehigh Valley Hospital. I was on a mechanical ventilator and an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, ECMO. I couldn’t move and I couldn’t run. My newborn baby was three weeks old and I hadn’t spent any time with him yet. I learned that I contracted a necrotizing spore forming pneumonia and had bacteria in my bloodstream. Despite all this, my son, Henry, was born healthy.</p>
<p>After two more weeks in the hospital, and a short stay at John Heinz Rehab Hospital, I finally went home to a loving family who had to do a lot for me. I had so much help from my husband, siblings, in-laws, and my church. Our church in Dallas, PA, Grace Community Church, cooked meals for us daily.</p>
<p>Ryan’s Run 6 is the perfect way to complete my first marathon since all of this happened. I want to raise money for people who cannot afford ECMO machines or power wheelchairs. I want to thank Allied Services for the amazing rehab care I received. This marathon isn’t about meeting a personal record, but about being healthy enough to run again, breathe on my own, and to thank the health care world for doing what we do best, giving people their lives back.</p>

                    <p>I am from Waverly Pennsylvania. I graduated from Misericordia University with a Bachelors Degree in Social Work and a specialization in addictions counseling. I currently work at Drug and Alcohol Treatment Services in Scranton as a primary drug and alcohol counselor in the DUI Department.</p>
<p>A dream of mine has always been to run the New York City Marathon. As a little girl, I watched my dad run numerous New York City Marathons. Eight years ago, my dad had a bicycling accident that left him in serious condition and he had to receive treatment from Allied Services. Six months later that same year my Uncle Kenneth McDonnell, my dad&#8217;s twin brother, had the same bicycling accident in Massachusetts. Ten months later, both were back in action doing triathlons. My dad credits his full recovery to the dedication and knowledge of his doctors and therapists at Allied. His experience changed his life, and even inspired him to begin working at Allied Services.</p>
<p>I am even more motivated to run in the TCS New York City Marathon with Ryan&#8217;s Run; to help raise money for those that experience injuries such as my Dad and Uncle Ken. My Dad made a promise to me 20 years ago that if one of his children decided to run a marathon, that he too would run another one. So my Dad, Stephen McDonnell will also be running the New York City Marathon in November! Thank you, Allied Services!</p>

                    <p>My name is Katy Martin. I have been running for over 25 years, beginning in high school. I have run eight half marathons and one full marathon. I guess you can say I’m addicted to the endorphin rush that results from a hard workout.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law, John Monahan, suffered a series of strokes three years ago. His wife, Marie Monahan, is the Director of Speech Pathology and Audiology at Allied Services. Marie also happens to be my sister. John received therapy from Allied and credits his talented and compassionate therapists for the extensive strides he has made in his recovery.</p>
<p>When I watched John and Marie walk jointly to home plate at PNC Field last June, I was, in the true sense of the word, awed. To see them walk together, accompanied by a team of gifted therapists, was a game changer for me. At that time, it was too late to apply for Ryan’s Run 5, so I planned for next year and here I am! John’s personal strength, tenacity and wit, coupled with Marie’s passionate devotion to John’s continued recovery, has been an inspiration to my entire family. I am running for Johnny!</p>

I made a pit stop in Milwaukee, WI for nearly five years to attend Marquette University for Engineering. I am the Senior Design Engineer of Advance Ballistic Helmets at Gentex Corporation. What I love most about my job is the satisfaction of knowing I’m saving lives within the military community around the world. Gentex Corporation is a proud premier sponsor of Mohegan Sun Pocono’s Clash for Cash, which is the largest CrossFit competition planned in NEPA to date. Mohegan Sun Pocono’s Clash for Cash will bring together CrossFit athletes from around Pennsylvania to raise funds for children and adults with disabilities at Allied Services.</p>
<p>This will be my second New York City Marathon, eleventh overall but the first as part of Ryan’s Run. I have run marathons from coast to coast including, Salt Lake City, UT, Seattle, WA and Scranton, PA’s very own Steamtown Marathon. When not being an “enginerd” or on the road running, I can be found at CrossFit 570, which is considered my second home. I most recently completed the Black Bear Half Ironman course in Jim Thorpe, PA.</p>
<p>I’m honored that I’ve been given the opportunity to be a part of Ryan’s Run 6. Allied Services has helped many people, whether adults or children, get back to normal lifestyles after experiencing traumatic injuries.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>I am a High School Guidance Counselor at East Stroudsburg South High School. I live in Spring Brook Township with my husband Matt and two wonderful children, (Matthew, 6 &#038; Andrew, 3). For as long as I can remember, my weight has always been a struggle. My turning point was when my second son turned one; I realized my weight had caught up to me again. I decided I was going to gain control of my life and strive to be healthy, this time for good. I had completed a few 5Ks in the past, but my first goal was to run one without walking. I joined Barrier Breakers in the fall of 2014 and was able to achieve this goal. After that, I set my goals even higher. I signed up for the Inaugural Scranton Half Marathon. I trained all winter, even though I hate winter. I successfully completed the half marathon and I was overwhelmed with a sense of accomplishment. I thought, wow let’s stick with this running thing and see what I can do!</p>
<p>Since then, I have run the Broad Street Run in Philadelphia with Team in Training, in honor of a high school friend battling cancer, as well as countless 5Ks, 10K&#8217;s and 3 half marathons. June 2014 I decided to join, Can’t Is Not an Option running club, and my outlook on running has changed completely. I started with the group to push myself further and to be a better runner. Not only did I get that push (have you ever tried running with a few marines as coaches), but I gained a family that allows me to stay accountable, socialize, and a sense of positive self that transfers to my world as a mom. The local running community is truly amazing and overwhelmingly supportive.</p>
<p>When the opportunity for Ryan’s Run came up, I felt I had to give it a try and apply. I am very blessed to have a healthy husband and children; I know everyone cannot say the same. I feel this is my chance to give back, because I can. It’s such a great way to stay accountable for my own fitness, but be a part of such a great cause, and show my children that you can make a difference even if you can&#8217;t write a big check yourself. Will this training be tough and time consuming? Absolutely, but so is the daily life of a person with a disability. If I am able to help just one person with a disability by running, my mission is accomplished.</p>
<p>I am extremely lucky to have a wonderful family supporting me on this journey. I am happy to say that several family members have begun their own running journeys and I am proud of their accomplishments. I am looking forward to being part of such a great team of people, and running together in NYC in the fall! Together we can make a difference, and we can inspire fitness, challenge disability, and change lives&#8230;one step at a time.</p>

                    <p>Eric lives in Greenfield Township (the Newton/Crystal Lakes area) of Lackawanna County. He and his wife, Michelle, celebrated their 21st wedding anniversary this past June. They are proud parents of two boys: Evan and Jackson. Professionally, he’s been a member of the Baker Tilly Vantagen team of benefits and HR professionals for the past 15 years.</p>
<p>A casual runner at the time, Eric decided to tackle a marathon for the first time in 1997 shortly after his mother’s passing. He used the experience to both heal and help, raising money for the American Cancer Society. That fall, he entered and completed his first Steamtown Marathon. </p>
<p>Feeling inspired, Eric set his sights on qualifying for the Boston Marathon in 1998. Injuries, a career-fueled relocation back to Northeast Pennsylvania, and the births of two children put that pursuit on hold for well over a decade. In 2012, Eric decided it was time to resume his Boston quest. His third qualifying attempt waged in the fall of 2014 (and fourth overall marathon) was the charm. This spring, he will compete in his first (and probably last) Boston Marathon, the 120th running of that prestigious event. </p>
<p>If you’re going to be physically active and involved in our community, Eric feels you can’t help but respect and appreciate the Allied Services mission and its proven impact.  Being a part of the Ryan’s Run team allows him to get physical, get involved, and get inspired by an organization that makes our region better in so many ways.</p>

                    <p>I live in Clarks Summit, PA with my husband and three young daughters. Even though I was very busy, I started running after the birth of my middle daughter. I wanted to try to maintain some sort of fitness level. I started walking at first, and soon found out that I could cover the same amount of ground in less time if I would just run! Since then, I have run five marathons and numerous half marathons. I love getting up in the morning to head out for a run, (rain, shine, or snow,) before the rest of the world is awake.</p>
<p>While working full-time and raising three children, it’s often hard to find time to give back to the community. Running has been that outlet for me. It allows me to do something I love, while supporting wonderful causes along the way. The running community in general is a very charitable one, as most races contribute to some charitable organization. To be chosen to be a part of Ryan’s Run is a dream come true! I am absolutely honored to be a part of Ryan’s Run 6, and to help support the critical role that Allied Services provides to the residents of Northeastern PA!</p>

                    <p>Having been chosen as a member of the Ryan’s Run 6 team is both an honor and a privilege to me, because it combines the two things that I hold dear: running and helping people in need. I was inspired to try long-distance running by a friend who ran the Chicago Marathon in 2006. I guess you can say I caught the “running bug.” Since then, with the support of my husband, I have been fortunate enough to complete eleven half marathons, and 6 marathons including the Boston Marathon in 2008 and 2013. As a mother of four, I have made good health and fitness a top priority. I encourage my kids to follow suit.</p>
<p>Another passion in my life is helping children. After spending ten years as a full-time parent, I am now a certified teacher. I work as a special needs instructor in the Early Intervention system. I work with children aged birth through three years old with developmental delays and special needs. Several of the children receive services from Allied Services. Knowing Allied helps so many people in our community; I am excited to be a part of the fundraising efforts of Ryan’s Run 6, while also having the amazing opportunity to run the incredible TCS New York City Marathon!</p>
<p>Along this journey, I hope to achieve success in my marathon training as well as my fund raising goals for the patients of Allied Services. Thank you Ryan’s Run for this exhilarating and humbling opportunity!</p>

                    <p>I reside in Clarks Summit with my husband Chris and our two daughters, Olivia and Maeve. I am a graduate of Penn State University with a degree in nursing. For the past eighteen years I have worked as a Registered Nurse in the hemodialysis setting.  </p>
<p>As a nurse I see the struggles that chronically ill patients endure every day. Completing simple tasks such as getting out of bed and getting dressed can be a huge obstacle for them. Many of my patients have utilized Allied Services and I have witnessed extraordinary outcomes. Allied Services has put smiles on faces that I never thought would ever smile again.  I love when a patient is able to do something that was once impossible for them.</p>
<p>I only recently began running in January 2010. I was working full time and my children were young.  Life was crazy but I had a desire to exercise and get in shape. My sister-in-law, Beth Pallman, is an avid runner and encouraged me to lace up and give running a try. I often refer to her as my coach. I started out with small miles and eventually worked my way up to my first race. So far, I have completed the Steamtown Marathon in 2011 and 2014, Run for the Red Marathon in 2015, and numerous 5K and half marathon races. I am beyond excited to be participating in the TCS New York City Marathon. </p>
<p>Running not only helps me stay in shape but it also helps me relieve stress. The best benefit so far has been the friends I have made. I formed an extended family and I often refer to them as my &#8220;running family.&#8221; My running family never allows me to get discouraged or down on myself. They push me to step out of my comfort zone and set new goals. We run in all kinds of weather and will meet each other at crazy times just to get our runs in. My husband and girls have been strong supporters of my running as well. They put up with my hectic training schedule and always let me know how proud they are of me.  There is nothing more uplifting than seeing my kids cheering me on at the finish line.  </p>
<p>I am honored to be chosen as a member of the Ryan&#8217;s Run 6 Team. This journey means so much to me and it will be one of the biggest endeavors I have ever taken on.  As a part of Team Leckey, I will not only be able to enjoy my passion for running but I will also be helping those in need by raising money for Allied Services. I am very grateful to be given this opportunity and plan on making the best of it. </p>

                    <p>I am beyond excited and honored to be part of the Ryan’s Run 6 team as a representative of Mohegan Sun Pocono. I have been a part of the Mohegan Sun Pocono family for the past 6 years, and I currently work in the Entertainment and Special Events Department. Through these years, I realized that everything I have been able to accomplish can be directly attributed to the unconditional love and support that I have received from my family, friends and colleagues. They have always believed in me, and in turn taught me to believe in myself. With that said, I believe that the mission of Allied Services is to teach people to believe in themselves and accomplish goals that they never thought possible. For this reason, I would like to do what I can to support their important mission. </p>
<p>I reside in Wilkes-Barre, PA and I am originally from Tunkhannock, PA.  I am a recent MBA graduate from Wilkes University where I have also earned a Masters Degree in Educational Strategies. I went to King’s College for undergraduate where I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Spanish and played softball and field hockey. This will be the first marathon I have ever run. I am extremely excited for this experience because I have had the fortunate opportunity of working with Allied Services in the past, and this whole group exudes an inspiring passion for helping people. Also, I would not classify myself as the most likely of marathon runners, but seeing that whole goal of Allied Services is to help people realize that they can overcome challenges and accomplish so much more than they ever thought possible, I look forward to the opportunity to face this challenge in order to help others to face their own challenges.</p>
<p>During the course of my training, in the middle of a long run, an amazing friend drove along side of me and handed a Gatorade out of the window of her car. I was not only extremely appreciative of the drink, but more so, that small gesture made me feel so happy and energized at a moment when I needed it most. Through this campaign, I hope to raise money to be able to offer support to others at the moments in their lives when they need it most through Allied Services. All of your support is so greatly appreciated!</p>

                    <p>Marathon training has been a significant part of my life since 1999. In the past sixteen years, I have completed thirteen full marathons, including: The Steamtown Marathon, Marine Corps Marathon, Walt Disney World Marathon, as well as the 2008 and 2013 Boston Marathons. This will be my first New York City Marathon. Over the years I have formed a deep connection with the running community. It’s the positive energy that keeps me moving.</p>
<p>Being selected as a member of Ryan’s Run 6 is a true honor as well as a personal highlight. I am eager to contribute to this cause because I have personally experienced the need for highly advanced health care facilities.</p>
<p>Thirty-two weeks into my pregnancy, my husband and I went for a routine ultrasound. Unfortunately, we learned that our son was going to be born with a craniofacial birth defect. Immediately, we were stifled by fear and had so many questions. Our mission became focused on seeking the best medical care that would provide our son with an opportunity to live a normal life. Through this experience, we learned that peace of mind is priceless. Knowing that you are in the best possible care is extremely comforting and makes all the difference. I am honored to be a part of a team that is working to provide that same peace of mind to patients in NEPA. I sincerely thank you for supporting my fund raising efforts and this great cause!</p>

                    <p>As a registered nurse at Allied Services, currently with the Developmental Services Division, we address the unique needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and assist them in reaching their fullest potential. This is a 24-hour facility, so we are like their family. I have also had the privilege to work at Allied Services Rehabilitation hospital, and with Allied Services Home Health. I have had the pleasure for the past 15+ years to be a part of a truly top-notch integrated health system.</p>
<p>I live in Clarks Summit with my wife Silvia, and sons Matt, who will be starting his second year at Temple University in the fall and Sam, a student at Abington Heights High School. I have been running for fitness regularly and this will be my first participation in a marathon. I have kept the hope of being able to run a marathon for some time, and was inspired by the last years Ryan’s Run participants while frequenting the Aronica Fitness Center. Throughout the years, I have worked with so many individuals with different disabilities. I am even more motivated in my first marathon quest because of them. It is thrilling to know that I can help them even more by running for them in the TCS New York City Marathon. I am lucky enough to get to see the benefits of Ryan’s Run every day. I&#8217;m looking forward to the challenges of each step of preparation toward the achievement of this goal.</p>
<p>Through my experience as an eBay power seller, I want to lend a hand in meeting and exceeding the Ryan’s Run charity fundraising goal. If you have unwanted collectibles, such as silver plate flatware sets, buttons, watches, figurines, vintage costume jewelry or paintings, you can help me make a difference. Please consider selling or donating unwanted items to <a href="http://www.remusvarietystore.com">www.remusvarietystore.com</a> for online resale, as I will be donating a portion of the sales to Ryan’s Run.

                    <p>I served in the U.S. Marine Corps and I&#8217;m retired from the Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Prisons. Currently, I am a running coach for &#8220;Can&#8217;t is not an Option.&#8221; I took up running five years ago when I suddenly decided to get healthy. My weight had reached 300lbs and I felt terrible. I had weight loss surgery and immediately began making changes in my life.</p>
<p>My initial goal after losing some weight was to complete a marathon, to prove to myself that I could do it. I did and then I caught the “bug” and fell in love with running. Since running that first marathon – Steamtown – I’ve run three more.<br />
I decided to share my passion for running with others and became a coach through Scranton Running Company and Barrier Breakers. Seeing people improve and meet goals like I did really makes me proud.</p>
<p>I’m inspired and motivated to have the chance to help a great organization like Allied Services. When my mother suffered a stroke she came to Allied Services. I’ve seen the improvements she’s made and the compassionate and caring way she was treated at Allied. It means a lot to me that I can harness my passion for running to help my community. When I’m running in New York City in November, I’ll be carrying Allied’s patients and their families in my heart. </p>

                    <p>The best part about running is when it&#8217;s over!  Each and every run is a test not only to get the miles in, but to also face the challenge of pushing yourself to get those miles in while trying to constantly improve.  I&#8217;ve been running since the 7th grade (G.A.R. Memorial) and continued competing throughout my collegiate career (Misericordia University).  Competition with not only the field of runners but also myself has developed my love of running.  Once that long run is done I feel on top of the world.  The entire day feels better.  All my friends at the Scranton Running Co. have helped me learn so much more about running than putting one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>I currently run around the aisles and on the field for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders as &#8220;B-Ray&#8221; as well working as the on-ice emcee for the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins.  Music is another passion of mine as I&#8217;ve been DJ&#8217;ing for over 5 years.  You better believe I&#8217;ll be bringing the sweet-sweet tunes to any event I&#8217;m apart of this fall!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proud to be able to run for something so much bigger than competition, as a member of Ryan&#8217;s Run 6.  Allied Services provides such an essential service to all who are in the ring with any type of recovery.  I&#8217;m extremely honored to be a part of this team and excited for the calendar filling up with fundraisers, events and races to help raise these very important funds.</p>

<p>I began running in 2013 for two reasons; I wanted to accomplish the goal of running a race from start to finish, and to begin a healthier lifestyle. I soon experienced the inspiration of running a race for a cause. It was around this time that I learned about Ryan’s Run and knew I wanted to be on the team someday.</p>
<p>I decided to apply this spring and was given a tour of the Allied Services facilities. I experienced all the ways Allied helps individuals. Their reach in the community was greater than what I had previously thought. Allied is known for its exceptional rehabilitation programs, but it has occupational and speech therapies, skilled nursing, as well as the dePaul School for Dyslexia, and much more.</p>
<p>I was so astonished to learn about all of the services that Allied provides for individuals in this area. I knew that I wanted to help too. It is my goal to raise money to help Allied Services continue to help our family and friends in their time of need.  Please help me help them by supporting me in this venture!</p>

                    <p>In 2013 I had the opportunity to run the ING New York City Marathon, my first, in honor of my Dad who unexpectedly passed away in August of that year due to a severe stroke. The therapeutic solitude I felt while running, combined with the feeling that my Dad was there with me as I crossed the finish line, is an experience I will cherish for the rest of my life. In 2014, I also ran the Amsterdam Marathon in my home country. The 2015 TCS New York Marathon will be my third. I will dedicate it to my father-in-law. He currently participates in a wide range of therapies at Allied Services, including Parkinson’s therapy classes.</p>
<p>I am a Dutch resident, but my wife Debbie is from Northeastern Pennsylvania. We currently live in Baarn, Netherlands with our one-year-old son Philippe. I started running in college and joined a running club five years ago to push myself to the next level. This club has become part of my extended family. With members of all ages and from all walks of life who support and look out for one another, it has taught me that running can lift people up.</p>
<p>To me running represents perseverance and family, but also solitude and rest from the daily stress of life. I have run many races that went smoothly, and some that were tough. Having run past marathons with a knee injury, I have a sense of the amount of perseverance Allied Services’ patients exhibit in reaching their goals.</p>
<p>Through a recent visit to Allied’s facilities, I have discovered the positive impact that awareness and fundraising campaigns have on so many people. Seeing how my father-in-law benefits from Allied’s diverse, high quality care makes me proud to run as a member of Ryan’s Run 6 in support of this tremendous organization.</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;m excited to be a part of the Ryan&#8217;s Run 6 team! I started running 35 years ago while attending Bishop Hoban High School in Wilkes-Barre, PA. I&#8217;ve kept at it ever since! I currently reside in Dallas, PA and have three children, Dominick, Zoe, and Angelo. </p>
<p>In addition to running, I also compete in triathlons, finishing my first full Ironman 140.6 in 2013. This couldn&#8217;t have been accomplished without the therapy I received from Allied Services, due to a cycling injury. So, that makes this cause especially near to my heart. </p>
<p>In total I have completed 17 triathlons, and 9 marathons, the 2015 TCS New York City Marathon will be number 10! I am also active in Martial Arts, holding a Black Belt in Tang Soo Do which I earned through training at Gallis Fighting Chance. </p>
<p>Please consider a donation to this very worthy cause which not only inspires fitness, but also challenges disability and changes lives for the better. Thank you for your support!</p>

                        <p><em>WNEP TV&#8217;s Ryan Leckey accepts a donation for $7,500 from Quantum Rehab Spokesperson Kiel Eigen and General Manager of Product Marketing, Richard McLane.</em></p>
<p>Long-time supporter, Quantum Rehab, a global innovator in consumer-inspired power wheelchairs, recently presented Allied Services with $7,5000 donation to benefit children and adults with disabilities at Allied Services.

<p>Eigen is a spokesperson for Quantum Rehab. Reflecting on the Ryan&#8217;s Run campaign, Eigen noted &#8220;I would like to take the time to personally congratulated and thank Ryan, WNEP, and everyone who contributed to making the 6th Ryan&#8217;s Run another success. Your hard work over the past few months has paid off. Raising $389,812.00 to help children and adults with disabilities really hits home with me. You will never fully grasp how much people like us are truly grateful for people like you. If it were not for the family and medical equipment at Allied Services, I can&#8217;t imagine where I would be today. This will benefit thousands of individuals lives here in NEPA. Thank You!&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to sponsoring the School Rules Challenge, Quantum showed its support for Ryan&#8217;s Run through a series of employee-led fundraising activities.

<p>Just days after WNEP TV’s Ryan Leckey and 33 other local runners completed the TCS New York City Marathon, Allied Services celebrated the end of another successful Ryan’s Run campaign, announcing a total of $389,812.00 raised in 2015. </p>
<p>The campaign officially kicked off in late-August at a concert hosted by 6-year corporate sponsor Mohegan Sun Pocono. In the following months, the Team Leckey runners put in many training miles to prepare for the big race, all while raising funds for the cause. Supporters turned out to cheer on runners and walkers at the Third Annual Ryan’s Run 5k and All-Abilities Walk, purchased official Ryan’s Run shirts and participated in fundraisers hosted by local schools, running clubs, and more, all to benefit the campaign.</p>
<p>“We’ve been overwhelmed by the continued generosity of our community, corporate sponsors, employees, local schools and runners” commented William Conaboy, President and CEO of Allied Services Integrated Health System. “We’re fortunate to have the support of so many partners and individuals who are committed to improving the lives of individuals with disabilities and life-changing injuries.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of WNEP TV, its major sponsors and the generosity of the local community, the Ryan&#8217;s Run campaign has raised more than $1.6 million since 2010. The proceeds from the Ryan’s Run campaign will benefit individuals with disabilities and life-changing injuries served by Allied Services, enabling the non-profit health system to invest in cutting-edge technology and services throughout Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Allied Services wish to thank media sponsors WNEP TV-15, corporate sponsors Baker Tilly, Jack Williams Tire, Mohegan Sun Pocono, Northeastern Rehabilitation Associates P.C., Weis Markets, Lamar Advertising, signature event sponsors Aon and Quantum Rehab, and the many Ryan’s Run supporters for their outstanding commitment to supporting children and adults with disabilities. </p>

<p><strong>About the TCS New York City Marathon</strong><br />
The TCS New York City Marathon is the premier event of New York Road Runners (NYRR) and the largest marathon in the world. Held annually on the first Sunday in November, the race features the world’s top professional athletes and a vast range of competitive, recreational, and charity runners. The race began in 1970 with just 127 entrants running four laps around Central Park, and expanded citywide in 1976. In 2014, a record 50,530 runners from 130 countries toured New York City’s five boroughs, starting on Staten Island at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and running through the neighborhoods of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, before ending in Manhattan at the iconic Central Park finish line. More than one million spectators line the city streets to cheer on the runners, while millions more watch the live television broadcast in the United States and around the world. The race is part of the Abbott World Marathon Majors, a series featuring the world’s top marathons—Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago, and New York—and crowning the top professional male and female marathoners of the series. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a leading global IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization, is the premier partner of NYRR and the title sponsor of the TCS New York City Marathon.
